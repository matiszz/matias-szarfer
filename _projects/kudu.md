Kudu helps you to better organize the free time you have in your schedule. We make it easy for you to get together with your loved ones, from a coffee with a friend you haven't seen in a while to an after-work beer with your team, if you are tired of endless and time-consuming conversations on chat platforms to organize a simple plan, such as a birthday or a trip, Kudu is the right tool for you because it provides:

* Organizer or guest function: you can initiate a plan or participate in one;
* A very easy way to decide who can join your plan;
* The option to generate a poll to decide the day and time;
* A voting process that allows everyone invited to actively participate in the decision making;
* Push notifications that will keep everyone informed about the progress of the plan;
* A calendar to keep your daily plans in mind;
* An inbox where you can find all your plans: the ones you are organizing, the ones you have joined, the ones you have declined, etc.
