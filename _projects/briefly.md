name: Brief.ly
short: A Chrome Extension to summarize texts based on OpenAI.
description: I've developed a Chrome Extension to create summaries of texts, using the OpenAI API. It works well, and it does a good job. Other software just removes unnecessary words from the text, while Brief.ly re-writes the whole text, paraphrasing it to make it more understandable.
